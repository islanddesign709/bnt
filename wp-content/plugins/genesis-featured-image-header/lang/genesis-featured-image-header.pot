"This will depend on a few factors. Each theme may have slightly larger or "

"the image. The plugin will insert the full size image that you upload (no "
"cropping is done). If you want exact dimensions, check out the Genesis "
"Visual Hook Guide Plugin (see link above). When viewing the page use the "
"Action Hooks option then right click the area you want to get the width for "
